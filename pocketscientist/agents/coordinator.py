Based on the current analysis state, determine the next best phase to execute.

Current Context:
{context}

CRISP-DM Phases:
1. business_understanding - Define objectives and requirements
2. data_understanding - Initial data exploration and quality assessment
3. data_preparation - Data cleaning, transformation, feature engineering
4. modeling - Select and apply modeling techniques
5. evaluation - Evaluate model performance and validate results
6. deployment_preparation - Prepare final recommendations and insights

Decision Criteria:
- Have we understood the business objective clearly?
- Do we understand the data structure and quality?
- Is the data ready for modeling?
- Have we built and evaluated models?
- Are we ready for final recommendations?
- Is there time remaining: {state.time_remaining:.0f} seconds
- Current iteration: {state.iteration_count}/{state.max_iterations}

Respond with a JSON object containing:
{{
    "next_phase": "phase_name",
    "reasoning": "explanation of why this phase is needed",
    "requires_iteration": true/false,
    "priority": "high/medium/low"
}}

If we've completed enough analysis or are running out of time, recommend "deployment_preparation" as the final phase.
